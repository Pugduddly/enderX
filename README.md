# enderX
Apple Platinum recreated in Java, with a built-in X server!

## Requirements
Anything that can run Java is supported.

## Building
You need Maven to build this project. That's it.

## Applications
An application for enderX is a standard JAR file with the extension `.app`.
Apps can have icons, too.
In order to add an icon to an app, rename the file to `Icon.png` and put it in the app's `META-INF` folder.

## X server
enderX uses a modified version of [WeirdX](http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/) 1.0.32.
By default, it uses display `:2`.

## Documentation
Coming soon :)
