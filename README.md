# enderX
Apple Platinum recreated in Java, with a built-in X server!

## Requirements
Anything that can run Java is supported.

## Download
I'm not supplying downloads yet because this project is in the early stages of development.
If you want to try it out for yourself, you gotta build it. It's not hard.

## Building
You need Maven to build this project. That's it.

## Applications
An application for enderX is a standard JAR file with the extension `.app`.
Apps can have icons, too.
In order to add an icon to an app, rename the file to `Icon.png` and put it in the app's `META-INF` folder.

## X server
enderX uses a modified version of [WeirdX](http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/) 1.0.32.
By default, it uses display `:2`.
